            <p><hi rend="italic">Bee-ing</hi> Human is an interdisciplinary research project
                gathering researchers and practitioners from literary studies, musicology, digital
                humanities and biology (animal behaviour). It centres on a seventeenth-century
                apiculture book, Charles Butler's <hi rend="italic">The feminine monarchie or the
                    history of bees</hi>, using it both as an object of study and as a departure
                point to contrast the early modern knowledge and culture around bees and beekeeping
                with the latest research in animal behaviour and emotion. </p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">The Feminine Monarchie</hi> was published three times during
                Butler’s lifetime: in 1609, in 1623, and in 1634. There are significant and
                interesting differences between all three editions: 1623 expands the text of the
                1609 edition in several respects and, most significantly, it includes a song
                (‘Melissomelos or Bee’s Madrigal‘) composed by Butler and inspired by the sounds of
                the beehive. 1634 by and large repeats the content of 1623, but it does so using a
                completely new orthography devised by Butler himself which attempts to encode
                phonetic English — the title now becomes <hi rend="italic">The femininʻ monarchiʻ,
                    or the histori of beeʻs</hi>. Butler’s influence on English apiculture is
                significant, and he is often called ‘The Father of English Beekeeping’ (Morse /
                Hooper 1985: 61). The Feminine Monarchie has been republished often well into the
                20th century, with the most recent edition in 2017 (Owen 2017). </p>
            <p>Literary scholars will study and edit Butler's original
                text, musicologists will study the compositions included in Butler's writing, as
                well as respond with new compositions and reinterpretations of the sound of bees and
                research results; biologists, inspired by Butler's book, will work on the emotional
                states of bees, and digital humanists will create the final output, a ‘digital bee
                book’ for the 21st century, that will gather all the material and research produced
                during the project, as well as create digital experiments to communicate the
                research methods employed by the different disciplines. Alongside this disciplinary
                research, we will record, document, and present our own interdisciplinary process,
                as bees with different roles working together for the good of the colony.</p>
            <p>The main output of <hi rend="italic">Bee-ing Human</hi>
                will be the ‘digital bee book,’ which is also the focus of our poster. The ‘digital
                bee book’ will capture and publish the research of the four different strands of
                this project in a digital platform that will be, itself, a site of experimentation
                on how to present research from disparate disciplines to a wider audience. </p>
            <p>The digital bee book will contain: a) a scholarly edition
                of Butler’s <hi rend="italic">Feminine Monarchie</hi>, b) research outputs from all
                strands of the project, c) digital experiments in recreating and presenting the
                results from laboratory work, and interacting with the research produced by the
                literary, musicological, and creative components of the project; and finally, d) a
                record of the interdisciplinary work of the project itself, including recordings,
                reflections, and provocative thoughts originating from our regular project
                workshops. </p>
            <p>The website will be built in Svelte with all interactivity
                handled in browser. The digital edition component will be encoded in TEI and made
                web-ready using CETEIcean, with the musical portions encoded in MEI, engraved into
                SVG using Verovio, with playback by a JS MIDI player like MIDIjs. The workflow for
                textual editing was to transcribe the text and convert it into a basic TEI file.
                After transcription and conversion, we began the collation phase recorded directly
                in TEI. The other strands of the project work concurrently and autonomously. The
                project team meets monthly to share progress, conduct a cross-disciplinary
                discussion with the intent of cross-pollinating research. Notes and thoughts from
                these meetings will be available on the final portal as part of the
                interdisciplinarity strand of the project.</p>
            <p>In this poster we will give an overview of the project and
                our research so far. We will focus on the initial attempts at creating a compelling
                and accessible Digital Bee Book, as well as the methodologies and workflows that we
                used to edit and present the Feminine Monarchy of Bees. The poster will include a
                description of the project, an illustration of the interdisciplinary workflow, an
                illustration of the editorial workflow, an illustration of the technology stack, and
                screenshots of various draft interfaces. We will present our initial experiments
                with design and user experience, reflecting on the extent to which we were able to
                adequately reconcile the various research strands into a coherent platform.</p>
