            <p>The closing ceremony of DH2019 marked the official beginning of a newly-restructured Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations, a process that was years in the planning, and was only formally completed at the end of 2022. Our new governance structure is rather more complex than the previous one, but also, we hope, more inclusive and diverse, in order to foster the diversity in participation and leadership that our community deserves and demands. One important aspect of this complexity, inclusivity, and diversity is the need for more people to get involved with ADHO.</p>
            <p>And yet, “getting involved” with ADHO is easier said than done. For many DH2023 conference attendees, ADHO may be a mystery: how it is organized, how its finances work, or how to volunteer for one of its committees. Much of this information is available on the ADHO website, but more of it is institutional knowledge shared by those who have been deeply involved in its creation and operation over the past 20 years and more. We want to share our experiences of the benefits and challenges of working with ADHO, and our vision for what ADHO can become with broader participation and engagement.</p>
            <p>This forum brings together people with insider knowledge of ADHO based on their participation on our many committees and in a variety of leadership roles in both ADHO and a few of its COs. These facilitators will briefly describe ADHO’s organizational structure, finances, committees, and activities, and will then open the floor for questions and discussion. We welcome even the most difficult questions and topics, and will strive to be honest and open about ADHO’s challenges. </p>
            <p>While all of the forum presenters currently hold some office in ADHO, we are also all individuals with our own experiences, opinions, privileges, and prejudices, and in this forum we will speak candidly as such. But we are united in our goals for the forum: to build trust, to foster transparency, and above all to create a more participatory and welcoming DH culture in our organizational structures and processes</p>
