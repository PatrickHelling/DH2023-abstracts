                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>Before modern communication networks, the source of each piece of information was
                    given explicit emphasis. Pre-20 <hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century
                    newspapers were essentially a chain of messages, each one accompanied by its
                    date and place of origin (Slauter 2012). These pieces of information which I
                    call <hi rend="bold">place-date headings</hi>, served as both a structuring
                    element and an indication of trustworthiness, allowing readers to contextualize
                    information that may have passed through many ports and towns before reaching
                    them. </p>
                <p>Although the circulation of news is a rapidly growing area of interest in
                    historical research, existing methods mainly rely on text reuse detection. <ref target="#KRUUSMAA_Krister_Communication_Landscapes_of_the_19th_Centur.xml_ftn1" n="1"/> While this method is useful for analysing the long-term circulation and
                    spread of textual motifs, it also has its limitations. Firstly, it requires high
                    computational resources, and secondly, there is currently no easy way to apply
                    text reuse across language borders. Although place-date headings can offer
                    solutions to both problems and some studies have used them (Castellanos et al.
                    2020, Oiva et al. 2020, Ryan 2018), there is still significant potential for
                    further exploration and systematization. This presentation aims to use a large
                    corpus of German-language newspapers to map the 19th-century European
                    communication network as seen from the Baltic provinces of the Russian Empire,
                    showcasing the value of this approach (Kruusmaa &amp; Vanamölder 2023). </p>
            </div>
            <div type="div1">
                <head>Data and methods</head>
                <p>The corpus consists of 18,499 issues of the German-language newspaper <hi rend="italic">Rigasche Zeitung</hi> published between 1802-1888. <ref target="#KRUUSMAA_Krister_Communication_Landscapes_of_the_19th_Centur.xml_ftn2" n="2"/> Published in Riga, one of the principal economic centres of the Baltic
                    Sea, it was arguably the most important daily periodical in the Baltic provinces
                    of the Russian empire. It primarily catered to the German-speaking elites of the
                    region but also strongly influenced the emerging local press in Estonian and
                    Latvian languages. </p>
                <p>Because of their relatively standardized nature, place-date headings in the
                    corpus can be captured with regular expressions. They require attention to OCR
                    and spelling variations but do not need training data and are easily adjustable
                    to eliminate false positives. This is a considerable advantage compared to NER,
                    which can require requires a large amount of annotations and can still yield
                    unsatisfactory results due to OCR errors and the difficulties of training a
                    model to fit historical text.</p>
                <p>Using regular expressions, I detected over 200 000 place-date pairs in the
                    corpus. I verified all the place names that occur at least 20 times (350
                    different locations) and linked them to coordinates. I then compared the dates
                    to the newspaper’s publication dates to calculate the time it took for a given
                    news item to reach Riga. The resulting data allows us to examine, for example,
                    how the average time for news from New York or Istanbul to reach Riga gradually
                    decreased during the century (see Fig. 1). I also applied a recent method,
                    top2vec (Angelov 2020), to model the underlying topics of the sections that
                    follow the place names and dates.</p>
                <figure>
                    <graphic n="1001" width="15.998472222222222cm" height="7.9551388888888885cm" url="Pictures/b3c15438b1c1f2ee50bf8aff4c084583.png" rend="inline"/>
                    <head>Figure 1: News speed from given locations (shown with a rolling average of
                        3 years)</head>
                </figure>
                <p>The analysis reveals long-term changes in the history of communications. Firstly,
                    the geographical distribution of the news and their speed reflects Riga’s close
                    connection to the German cultural and economic sphere. The travel time of news
                    can be visualized intuitively with map transformations that stretch distance
                    based on the average speed of news (see Fig. 2). The most frequently mentioned
                    places of origin are found in German areas, while locations in the Russian
                    empire are mostly limited to St. Petersburg, the imperial capital, and some
                    other Russian cities trailing far behind. News from European overseas colonies,
                    the United States and Asia also make up a reasonable part of the news.</p>
                <p>Long-term analysis also makes it possible to observe the impact that the
                    introduction of railway transport and telegraph networks had on Riga in the
                    early 1860s. This is reflected in the speed of news which drops to just a few
                    days for many distant locations. It also affects the geographic distribution of
                    news, as commerce and communication become increasingly centred on a small
                    number of interconnected metropolises. In 1870-1890 for example, half of the
                    information in the newspaper comes only from four places: Paris, London, St.
                    Petersburg and Vienna.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="div1">
                <head>Applications to historical research</head>
                <p>While place-date headings provide insight into long-term changes, they also allow
                    us to examine specific historical events by providing an overview of the source
                    of news. In a case study on the Crimean War (1853-1856), I demonstrate their
                    potential when combined with topic modelling. Among the 385 topics identified in
                    the corpus, four have a direct connection to the war, labeled as <hi rend="italic">war events</hi>, <hi rend="italic">navy</hi>, <hi rend="italic">recruitment</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">reinforcement</hi>.
                    The temporal distribution of these topics closely matches developments in the
                    war. </p>
                <figure>
                    <graphic n="1002" width="11.049cm" height="10.31875cm" url="Pictures/dee64bf4e767a1ead207f20f859f76bd.png" rend="inline"/>
                    <head>Figure 2: Spatial visualiszation of time for news to reach Riga, in the
                        pre-industrial period, 1802–1859</head>
                </figure>
                <p>Examining the place-date headings of news in these topics reveals that residents
                    of Riga relied mainly on sources from Western Europe for information about the
                    war. Paris and London, the capitals of Russia's rival powers in the war, were
                    the main sources of significant news. Throughout the conflict, England and
                    France invested heavily in communication with the war zone and had greater press
                    freedom than Russia, which struggled with slow connections to its borderlands
                    and attempted to censor any war news in the domestic press. Readers in Riga were
                    aware of their reliance on their adversaries' information sphere, as Western
                    news about the war were occasionally accompanied by editorial comments
                    attempting to refute the information.</p>
                <p>Place-date headings provide a straightforward and effective means of studying
                    news circulation. They are an integral part of a newspaper's structure, enabling
                    analysis with minimal computational costs and across languages. They are useful
                    for uncovering both long-term changes in the communication networks used by the
                    press and for studying the circulation dynamics of specific events.</p>
