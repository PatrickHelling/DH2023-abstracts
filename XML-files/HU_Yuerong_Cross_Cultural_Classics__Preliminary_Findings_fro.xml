        <body>
            <p>Due to the lack of historical records on reading (Milligan, 2016), many aspects of readership studies remained theoretical and/or anecdotal until the 21st century. In the last two decades, the abundance of user-generated book reviews online has filled this gap and created unprecedented opportunities for empirical research on readers, books, and reading activities. Empirical findings based on user-generated book reviews have enriched and advanced our understanding of literary genres, cultural products, readerships, and so on (Bartley, 2009; Bourrier / Thelwall, 2020; Pianzola et al., 2022). For instance, with user-generated reviews collected from Goodreads, a U.S.-based social reading and book reviewing website, Walsh and Antoniak identified that “amateur critics” have curated a narrower sense of “classics”, under the impacts of schooling, industrial stakeholders of books, and algorithmic moderation of e-commerce (Walsh / Antoniak, 2020). </p>
            <p>However, limitations and gaps also emerge from existing research. Most frequently studied books and readerships remain those with distinguished popularity, commercial success, social impacts, and scholarly prestige in the Anglophone world, which are subject to historical and social-cultural biases such as classism, sexism, racism, colonialism (Antoniak / Walsh, 2020; So / Wezerek, 2020). Within this limited research scope, reciprocal and multiplier effects have emerged, where various book review platforms, booksellers, and book impact indicators (e.g., the MLA International Bibliography, the Open Syllabus Project) echo each other's opinions and endorse the same groups of books (Bao / Chang, 2014; Bourrier / Thelwall, 2020; Maity et al., 2017). To expand the current research landscape and enhance cultural inclusiveness and diversity, as Pianzola et al. advocated in their DH2022 panel, multi-lingual and cross-cultural datasets remain much needed (Pianzola et al., 2022). </p>
            <p>Following such advocations, we examined the classics curated by online book reviewers in cross-cultural scenarios. Here cross-cultural scenarios feature linguistic and geological differences in user bases across platforms (data sources). Leveraging existing datasets (Hu et al., 2022; Walsh / Antoniak, 2021; So / Weber, 2021), we conducted a comparative analysis of the “classics” curated on Goodreads based in the U.S., and Douban based in China as an Anglophone vs. non-Anglophone book review case study. Table 1 provides a comparison of the two platforms selected based on our prior work (Hu et al., 2022; Kiu-Chor, 2007; So / Weber, 2021).</p>

                <head>Table 1. Comparison of Goodreads and Douban</head>
            </figure>
            <p>For Goodreads classics, we leveraged a sample of 144 classics identified by Walsh and Antoniak based on users’ shelving and tagging (Walsh / Antoniak, 2021). For Douban, we selected the 141 books that had on the Douban Top 250 Books list from 2011 to 2021 and were tagged as “classics” and/or “canons” (Hu et al., 2022). Figure 1 visualizes the distribution of the two sets of “classics” curated on Goodreads and Douban. As we can tell from the overlap in the middle of Figure 1, only 21 works are simultaneously Goodreads and Douban classics, while the others are curated as classics on either Goodreads or Douban. Furthermore, the word clouds in Figure 1 show the most frequent user-generated tags associated with these classics: the blue words on the left are the most frequent tags assigned to the Goodreads classics, while the orange words on the right are those on Douban. The larger the text, the more frequently the tags have been used. For example, we can tell from Figure 1 that “literature” is frequently used on both platforms for tagging classics, while certain genre/theme tags are exclusively popular on either Douban (e.g., “martial arts”, “manga”) or Goodreads (e.g., “gothic”, “dystopia”). Such differences in book lists and tags indicate high-level divergences of collective understanding of classics across Goodreads and Douban.</p>

                <head>Table 2. Goodreads and Douban’s Differences in (1) Overall Ratings; (2) Numbers of Ratings; and (3) Distributions of Ratings</head>
            </figure>
            <p>In addition, we collected and analysed the user-generated ratings and numbers of ratings on both platforms. We measured the differences in parallel ratings, numbers of ratings received per book, and the distributions of the 1-to-5-star ratings for the same books (only the most rated edition/copy) across platforms. Table 2 provides our preliminary findings, as is shown in Table 2. For instance, Table 2 Column 3 shows that on average, each classic receives 196,121 more ratings on Goodreads than on Douban. </p>
            <p>Currently, we are further comparing the quantitative and qualitative features of these Goodreads and Douban classics to reveal more differences across the platforms and further understand their implications for ongoing research. While this case study based on Goodreads and Douban makes a unique contribution to the existing cross-cultural analysis of user-generated book reviews, we look forward to expanding our cross-cultural comparisons to other readerships and platforms through collaboration.</p>
