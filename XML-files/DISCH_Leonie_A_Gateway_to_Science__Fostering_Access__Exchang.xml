            <p>Digital access to Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH)
                research resources is necessary to enable wide-scale use and reuse. However,
                regarding the access and usage of digital SSH research resources, we have identified
                - based on analyses and literature - the following challenges at the current state
                for SSH communities are:</p>
            <p>1) No single access point allows SSH researchers to
                explore, find, access, and reuse materials such as literature, data, projects, and
                researcher profiles at the European level (competitor analyses; Breitfuss et al.,
                2022; Dumouchel et al., 2020b) → <hi rend="bold">Low visibility of SSH research
                    results</hi>. </p>
            <p>2) SSH researchers have comparatively little experience
                and skills in using digital services/tools/platforms (user requirement analyses;
                Dumouchel et al., 2020a; Dumouchel et al., 2020b) → <hi rend="bold">Lack of digital
                    literacy in the SSH community</hi>. </p>
            <p>3) Other potential users of SSH research (SMEs,
                journalists, citizens, policymakers) struggle to leverage these resources
                (Ross-Hellauer et al., 2022) → <hi rend="bold">Low usage of SSH research results
                    outside academia (SMEs, journalists, citizens, policymakers)</hi>. </p>
            <p>4) SSH research is not seen as "valuable" (Olmos-Peñuela
                et al., 2014) → <hi rend="bold">Low perceived impact on SSH research</hi>. </p>
            <p>Because of these challenges, a clear need for a digital
                open science platform that targets them is apparent. Such a platform should also be
                openly accessible so that anyone can access these resources. Based on the motivation
                to address these challenges, the European GoTriple discovery platform<ref target="#DISCH_Leonie_A_Gateway_to_Science__Fostering_Access__Exchang.xml_ftn1" n="1"/> dedicated to the
                SSH data including researchers' profiles and research projects, open to the whole
                scientific community and other socio-economic actors and citizens, was created.
                GoTriple responds to requests from SSH researchers to foster interdisciplinarity and
                enhance collaborations. The platform makes more than four million publications and
                datasets available from leading European aggregators, local repositories in less
                represented languages, more than three million researchers’ profiles, and more than
                20,000 research projects.</p>
            <p>Five innovative services complement this approach by
                making available a trust building system, a recommender system, a visualisation
                tool, an open annotation tool and a crowdfunding service. Based on a co-design
                approach, the multicultural and multilingual GoTriple platform is indexing research
                data available in ten languages (Croatian, English, French, German, Greek, Italian,
                Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and Ukrainian) and in Slovenian by the end of the
                year.</p>
            <p>To that extent, multilingualism is a core aspect of the
                platform. English as a lingua franca within scholarship is threatening the use of
                other languages which are especially relevant in the SSH disciplines dealing with
                locally relevant research. The widespread use of English in scholarly communication
                tends to marginalize non-English works and to make these works more difficult to
                access by most researchers. From the perspective of open science, GoTriple is
                promoting equity, diversity, inclusivity principles and closer connections to each
                language.</p>
            <p>The TRIPLE consortium, consisting of 21 partners from 14
                European countries<ref target="#DISCH_Leonie_A_Gateway_to_Science__Fostering_Access__Exchang.xml_ftn3" n="3"/>,
                developed an interoperable multilingual discovery service for SSH research fields to
                enable scientists to make research results findable by searching in their own
                language and to make research results in different European languages available. A
                machine learning methodology was developed to train the search engine by documents
                in each language and a controlled vocabulary was created to deliver a TRIPLE
                thesaurus, currently composed of more than 4,000 concepts with labels in each of the
                27 SSH disciplines (according to the MORESS categories<ref target="#DISCH_Leonie_A_Gateway_to_Science__Fostering_Access__Exchang.xml_ftn4" n="4"/>),
                in the eleven languages. The thesaurus was a prerequisite to align the vocabularies
                in the languages and for instance to find Greek documents with polish keywords. The
                GoTriple Vocabulary was initially based on the Library of Congress Subject
                    Heading<ref target="#DISCH_Leonie_A_Gateway_to_Science__Fostering_Access__Exchang.xml_ftn5" n="5"/> (LCSH) and used
                primarily by the annotation service of GoTriple platform. The constitution of the
                textual training dataset of SSH sources can be reused for training machine learning
                and artificial intelligence algorithms. This corpus currently comprises more than
                250,000 documents and has been tested in production for the implementation of the
                automatic classification service in GoTriple. For less represented languages in the
                scholarly literature such as Croatian, Polish, Ukrainian and Slovenian, the research
                community of these countries were solicited to contribute to finding relevant
                documents to train the system and appropriately translate the defined concepts. The
                solution is a publicly available SSH vocabulary, published in an open format (e.g.,
                SKOS). The eleven included languages are expandable. It can be integrated into
                various types of platforms (via JSON/database file import or more dynamically by
                using the API that will be developed). The classification process is unique:
                algorithms for automatic classification and translation and human-curated
                classification and translation. Standardisation is necessary to offer efficient,
                useful, and updated vocabularies. This work is notably valuable to increase the
                impact and foster the reuse of research for the SSH communities worldwide.</p>
            <p>To advance research, it is also necessary to improve the
                means of collaboration between the scientific community and society, which too often
                remains impervious to scientific work and, more particularly, to SSH. One way to
                increase the impact of SSH research in society is to directly involve citizens in
                research projects to make them actors. The OPERAS<ref target="#DISCH_Leonie_A_Gateway_to_Science__Fostering_Access__Exchang.xml_ftn6" n="6"/> crowdfunding service
                is addressing this issue by introducing non-funded projects to a large audience.
                This service is integrated into the platform by giving direct and easy access to
                both researchers and contributors. </p>
            <p>Users' requirements are evolving fast, and there is a
                strong need from the research community to provide scalable services. The challenge
                of innovation is to ensure sustainability. This will require efforts and
                collaboration of the consortium not only to maintain the platform in the long term
                but also to improve its services by indexing new repositories, reinforcing the
                coverage of some languages, and maintaining integrated services. To reach this
                needed long-term sustainability the project applied Alan Cooper’s interaction design
                principles, namely <hi rend="italic">desirability</hi>, <hi rend="italic">feasibility</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">viability</hi>, in developing a
                suitable platform Business Model (BM) (Cooper at al., 2007). The developed business
                model is backed up by a suitable governance model and a well elaborated business
                plan. </p>
