            <p>In this presentation we go through some preliminary steps
                towards the goal of analyzing Norwegian literary texts and map them to a discourse
                representation. Such a representation makes texts available for a narrative
                analysis, like extracting properties and relationships between characters, for
                example along the lines of Piper (2017, 2016). </p>
            <p>A character is modeled as its textual occurrences: names,
                pronominal references and appellations. This will provide the basis for an
                approximation to discourse models (e.g. Kamp and Reyle (1993)) and Piper (2016). For
                example, a character “John” in the text “John drinks water, the guy was thirsty, and
                he is happy”, the words “John”, "guy" and “he” form a chain (“John”,"guy", “he”),
                which we take to represent the character named John. However, in this presentation
                we will limit ourselves to proper names and pronouns. The character will in turn be
                connected to the predicate, drinks, thirsty and happy. </p>
            <p>The features we report on here is the inventory of
                pronouns in Norwegian literature. How long are sequences of pronouns, and how many
                are there in Norwegian novels? We split the pronouns up into several categories. </p>
            <p>Among the referential pronouns are the first, second and
                third persons, which in Norwegian are: first jeg, second du, third han (masc), hun
                (fem), det (neut), den (genderless) as well as place indicators: dit and der
                (there). Additionally there are case variants like possessive forms and accusative
                as well as unexpressed pronouns like subjects of infinitives. We keep the relative
                pronouns out from the counts, but will try to accommodate infinitives. We do not
                take into consideration diegetic level, like indirect speech.</p>
            <p>The actual counts for Norwegian are done using the digital
                resources from the Norwegian National Library as well as the tools from its Digital
                humanities lab (see digital resources). There are around 600 000 book texts
                digitally available. For counting word occurences we select a subset equipped with
                Dewey decimal number series 800 (general fiction), written between 1950 and 2022
                with language code ‘nob (Norwegian bokmål)’, which contains approximately 100 000
                individual books . In the table below there are two columns, one for all pronouns,
                and one for the third person gendered pronouns (han, hun), where the numbers
                indicate percentages of the total:</p>

            <p>The maximum values clearly represents outliers, given the
                standard deviation og about half the mean.</p>
            <p>We illustrate how to compute the ratio of names to
                pronouns by using the name recognition tool (see resources) which lets us analyze
                the content of an arbitrary book. The table below has the numbers for two works:
                Knut Hamsun’s “Markens grøde” and Agnar Mykle’s “Sangen om den røde rubin”.</p>

            <p>These two novels show the suspected span between names and
                pronouns, here ranging from about one third to one sixth. </p>
            <p>The construction of reference chains goes through a series
                of steps.Step 1 provides a parse of each sentence resulting in parts of speech,
                syntactic relations and names of people. In step 2 we extract all relations of named
                objects (e.g. protagonist) and also the list of pronouns. A shallow discourse is
                constructed as a step 2, by linking the pronouns to their potential referents, here
                taken to be the named objects. Step 3, final step, collects all names with their
                properties, subj-verb, verb-obj, subj-pred, so that we get a bag of words connected
                to each character. Then characters are compared using these cooccurrences</p>
