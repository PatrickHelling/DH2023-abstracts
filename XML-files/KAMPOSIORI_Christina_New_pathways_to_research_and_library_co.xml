            <p>This paper explores the potential that Virtual Reading
                    Rooms (VRRs) and Virtual Teaching Spaces (VTSs) offer for interdisciplinary
                    collaboration between digital humanities researchers and library professionals.
                    Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, remote technologies have been
                    employed by many collection-holding institutions, including research libraries,
                    as an emergency response to lockdowns, partial re-openings, and ongoing
                    disruption of movement. As academics, researchers, and students were prevented
                    from getting physical access to collections due to the closure of libraries and
                    archives, VRRs and VTSs constituted an alternative way of accessing physical
                    materials digitally, without relying on digitisation.</p>
            <p>In the post-Covid era, VRRs and VTSs become increasingly integrated into the existing service offering of institutions given the variety of benefits they have for researchers, students, and other users globally. More specifically, VRRs and VTSs provide human-mediated remote digital access to collections which do not depend on digitisation. Through the use of live streaming via hi-res visualisers positioned within physical research spaces, scholars, teachers or members of the public can view and digitally engage with an institution’s heritage and cultural collections, asking for these to be positioned and repositioned by a member of staff, to enable their research. These are emerging and bespoke services which provide another means of user-responsive access to collection materials. </p>
            <p>Research Libraries UK (RLUK), in collaboration with its
                    partners, has been tracking the development of these services since 2020 and
                    investigating their potential as digital research infrastructure. It has
                    conducted three international studies exploring the institutional perspectives
                    with regards to their creation and delivery as well as the academic perception
                    and use of the services. This paper is based on the results of the two most
                    recent studies (Kamposiori 2022a, Kamposiori 2022b) and aims to highlight the
                    potential of remote technologies to provide new pathways for collaboration
                    between library professionals and digital humanities researchers.</p>
            <p>For the purposes of the first study, a survey was launched
                to document and understand the institutional processes in research libraries and
                archives for developing and delivering VRR and VTS services. This survey was
                completed by 22 institutions in the UK and Ireland, US, and Australia and, according
                to our findings, some library professionals were found to actively contribute to the
                work of the researchers participating in the consultation process. As reported by
                our participants, the delivery of a VRR session often entailed a lengthy preparation
                which included conducting their own research on the topic or material to be
                consulted. During the VRR session, it was common to point at the details in
                collection items and converse and interact with researchers about their projects or
                different elements in the material as well as recommend other related materials and
                repositories.</p>
            <p>Thus, in several cases, the responsibilities that library
                    staff members had during the delivery of VRR services were much more complex
                    compared to the process followed during a usual in-person visit and resembled
                    more those of a research assistant or partner. Also, it is worth noting that a
                    wide variety of collections were being presented through these services. These
                    ranged from archives and special collections to museum objects, and art
                    collections while, sometimes, these were combined with data visualisations,
                    demonstrating a cross-collection and format application. Finally, library
                    professionals were frequently collaborating with academics in the delivery of
                    VTS sessions for students.</p>
            <p>As part of the second study, which aimed to explore the
                academic experience and perceptions of VRRs and VTSs, a survey was completed by 38
                participants mainly from the academic and research community in the UK, but also
                from South Africa, Canada, Europe, New Zealand, and the US. Thinking about the
                disciplinary background, they were mainly from the Arts and Humanities- including
                Digital Humanities - and Cultural Heritage areas. </p>
            <p>Based on our results, the academics, researchers, and
                students in this study who had previous experience of using VRRs and VTSs often
                reported on the positive impact that the services had for their research, teaching,
                and study. Regarding the reasons they were using the services, these were mainly for
                reference checking and to confirm document contents or relevance. Other popular
                reasons included to conduct original research when it was not possible to visit
                in-person, to conduct a preliminary survey of material in advance of an in-person
                visit, and to seek advice and knowledge from library and archive professionals. </p>
            <p>Besides the more apparent benefits that VRRs and VTSs can
                    offer to researchers, which can range from quick, reliable, and low-cost access
                    to material that is not digitised or catalogued in detail to the opportunity to
                    network and work closely with library staff, some examples revealed the
                    innovative and creative possibilities through which VRRs can enhance research
                    and teaching. For example, one participant expressed their interest in mixing
                    traditional object-handling with VRR sessions as part of their teaching practice
                    to increase student experience. Another argued about the potential of the VRR
                    process to become part of artistic research, such as through featuring within
                    live or screened performance that focuses on archives and collections, or
                    practice-led research employing virtual and augmented reality technologies.
                    Given that the employment of VRRs and VTSs by libraries and archives is very
                    recent, there has been very little discussion in academic literature around the
                    alternative uses of these technologies, including the collaborative potential
                    they offer.</p>
            <p>As institutions, such as research libraries, consider
                    further developing their VRR and VTS services through, for example, including
                    born-digital material in the collection types to be offered for consultation and
                    running blended and hybrid sessions, the benefits to digital humanities research
                    and teaching increase. So do the possibilities for collaboration which can lead
                    to innovative research projects, while also offering the chance to researchers
                    to contribute towards informing digitisation and other institutional processes,
                    including the creation of digital humanities resources and tools. Through
                    presenting the results of the two RLUK studies, this paper will aim to unpack
                    the paths to interdisciplinary collaboration that VRRs and VTSs offer, including
                    the opportunities and challenges these will entail for library professionals and
                    researchers.</p>
