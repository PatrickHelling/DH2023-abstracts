                <p>Financial economists and psychologists agree that collective sentiment plays a
                    crucial role in financial markets (Akerlof and Shiller 2009, Tuckett 2011). In
                    this paper, we present our workflow for creating a daily aspect-based index that
                    captures the sentiment at the Berlin Stock Exchange from 1872 to 1930, a time
                    when Berlin was the key financial market in Germany. This index is based on
                    market reports published every trading day in the Berliner Börsen-Zeitung, which
                    give a verbal description of the sentiment among market participants. Due to
                    daily publication and the long observation period, our corpus consists of about
                    18,000 market reports. We apply a combination of expert annotation and machine
                    learning. With this newly-created data, we will be able to gain a better
                    understanding of the historical German stock market and, more generally, the
                    nature of financial sentiment itself.  How has sentiment developed over time and
                    how is it related to historical events? Did sentiment influence prices and/or
                    trading volume, or vice versa? To answer such questions, we need data on
                    financial sentiment which, to our best knowledge, is not available for the
                    aforementioned case yet. From a DH perspective, this paper covers two novel
                    aspects: First, we focus on both historical and highly domain-specific language,
                    a dual challenge that thus far has rarely been addressed. As there are many
                    similar historical sources, such as reports by chambers of commerce, our
                    solutions will be helpful for future research. Second, we address a
                    characteristic but neglected feature of financial texts that might be relevant
                    also in a broader sentiment analysis context. Particularly, we focus on aspect-
                    and entity-based sentiment analysis.</p>

                <head>Method and Corpus</head>
                <p>There is an abundance of financial texts, such as newspapers, financial reports,
                    or tweets. Accordingly, many scholars have applied some form of natural language
                    processing to quantify sentiment. Beginning with the work by Tetlock (2007),
                    scholars first relied on dictionaries to perform sentiment analysis (e.g.,
                    García 2013, Hanna et al. 2020). As machine learning approaches display better
                    performance (Mishev et al. 2020, van Atteveldt 2021), scholars have started to
                    use more advanced methods, especially language models such as BERT and FinBERT
                    (Araci 2019, Malo et al. 2014). One reason is that financial texts pose several
                    distinct problems for sentiment analysis (Njølstad et al. 2014, Loughran and
                    McDonald 2011, Xing et al. 2020). One of them regards the role of entities which
                    can complicate sentiment analysis considerably (Sinha et al. 2022). In our case,
                    a major challenge is that texts include statements referring to entities at
                    three different levels: individual assets (category 1), industries or sectors
                    (category 2), and the overall stock market (category 3). Typically, sentences
                    contain multiple entities from different levels, often with different sentiment
                    valuations. As we are primarily interested in overall market sentiment, we must
                    account for these differences to avoid misleading sentiment scores.</p>

                <p>Our corpus and workflow are outlined in Figure 1, several aspects of which shall
                    be mentioned briefly. The removal of confounding sentences includes those
                    containing numerical expressions stating pure information and neutral sentences.
                    The first type of sentence was removed using heuristics, the latter a
                    classification step (see below). We performed this pre-processing because Wilson
                    et al. 2009 have shown that removing neutral sentences can increase
                    classification performance. The training set was created by a financial
                    historian, making use of the standardized financial language and primary sources
                    on historical stock markets (e.g., Krupke 1904, Kautsch 1912). In a first run,
                    the expert annotated 1,500 random sentences in a three-step procedure (see
                    Figure 2):</p>
                <p>i) Sentence type: does the sentence contain a sentiment-related statement? (If
                    not, the sentence was discarded from further analysis.)</p>
                <p>ii) Entity category: which categories do the entities mentioned in the sentence
                    belong to?</p>
                <p>iii) Aspect-based sentiment: which sentiment is connected to a given entity?</p>
                <p>In a second run, the expert annotated another 750 sentences to address systematic
                    errors. We included entity-level classification during this stage because we
                    lack information on named entities due to various issues (spelling,
                    abbreviations, OCR errors, etc.). Also, NER often has trouble recognizing
                    industry-type entities even for modern financial texts (Sinha et al. 2022). </p>
                <p>Sentence type and entity level classification were tackled employing the standard
                    procedure of finetuning a language model using a classification head (Devlin et
                    al. 2018). Our base model was a German BERT trained by the MDZ. We train for 15
                    epochs and choose the best model based on the macro averaged F1-score. For macro
                    average the Precision/Recall/F1 values are calculated per class and then
                    averaged, weighing every class equally. We chose this as a target metric to
                    avoid a bias toward any specific class overall. </p>
                <p>Aspect-based sentiment was tackled using a sentence-pair classification similar
                    to NLI tasks (Sun et al. 2019): A sentence (premise) was combined with a
                    formulation of the aspect related sentiment (hypothesis) and classified if the
                    sentences match. We use the hypothesis formulation: “Die Stimmung bezüglich
                    [aspect] ist [label]”. After some experiments, the best model was achieved by
                    finetuning using Compacter Adapter (Mahabadi et al. 2021), increasing macro F1
                    significantly over standard finetuning. The resulting performance of these
                    models is reported in the next section.</p>

                <head>Evaluation and Preliminary Results</head>
                <p>Tables 1-3 show the respective evaluation of each machine learning step. The
                    sentence-type classification shows high performance, especially in recall of
                    sentences containing tonality (96,5%), which is vital for the following steps.
                    The aspect-based sentiment classification shows an F1 macro average of 85.9%.
                    While there is still room for improvement, we argue that since there is no
                    significant difference among classes, the systematic error will not change the
                    overall trend of the chronological analysis.</p>

                <p>Figure 3 shows aggregated monthly sentiment scores for every category. To
                    identify trends, we applied twelve-month moving averages, which reveals clear
                    periods of positive/negative sentiment. Some of them appear straightforward,
                    such as the decline of sentiment after the stock market crash in 1873, others
                    are more surprising. For example, there seems to be no trace of the financial
                    turmoil that took place around 1900.</p>

                <p>In this paper, we describe the process of annotating a corpus of historic German
                    stock market reports with aspect-level sentiment. We focused on the
                    methodological part, making our procedure as transparent as possible, enabling
                    readers to comprehend the data if they intend to use it, once it is
                    published.</p>
                <p>Obviously, our results demand further in-depth
                        analysis, both technical and historiographical. A more comprehensive historiographical interpretation
                        of the results is part of plannedfuture work.A natural starting point will be to determine the
                        correlation of the three indices with macro-historical data, such as stock
                        market indices or GDP. Also, the training data could be extended to include
                        concrete entities, which would allow us to identify individual companies. If
                        we were able to provide company-level sentiment data, this could be combined
                        with share price data that is created by other financial historians, opening
                        the research on financial sentiment also to a business history
                        perspective.</p>
