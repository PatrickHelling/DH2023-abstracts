                    <head>Brief Abstract</head>
                    <p>This 3-hour workshop will introduce span categorization as a method for the
                        machine-annotation of text for various research tasks in the digital
                        humanities. Participants will gain a conceptual understanding of how span
                        categorization differs from entity recognition and complete practical
                        exercises to train a spaCy span categorizer on the LitBank dataset. </p>
                </div>
                <div type="div2">
                    <head>Description</head>
                    <p>Annotation is fundamental to the analysis of text. Scholars mark significant
                        sections of a text with key ideas and phrases. By marking the text, we add
                        information, create connections, and form interpretations. This text markup
                        can be captured as data through systems such as TEI and used as training
                        data for statistical language models. Automating this process makes it
                        possible to annotate a large corpus of texts for research tasks such as
                        creating digital editions or text mining.  </p>
                    <p>Named entity recognition (NER) is a common method
                            for identifying consistent entities such as the names of people, places,
                            and organizations in a text. In our DH2019 workshop “Introduction to
                            Natural Language Processing for DH Research with SpaCy” (<ref target="https://medium.com/@ajanco_76905/digital-humanities-spacy-workshop-bd71d69a4641"> more </ref>), we demonstrated how digital humanists could train a
                            NER model to identify early modern place names using training data from
                            a TEI encoded text from the Perseus Collection. </p>
                    <p>Named entity recognition is very effective for
                            finding clear syntactic units like proper names or place names. However,
                            digital humanists frequently work with literary and historical materials
                            whose names, places, and ideas have significant variations. Digitized
                            documents contain OCR errors which adds further variation. The objects
                            we mark in a text can also be abstract, such as allusion, metaphor, or
                            affect. For example, the “Mapping Imagined Geographies” project (<ref target="https://maprr.iath.virginia.edu/place_based_concepts"> link </ref>) seeks to annotate place-related concepts and
                            toponyms in poetic texts.  Many of these are imagined or metaphorical
                            places such as “the promised land” or “the new world.” A place can play
                            many roles in a text, such as the setting or the destination of a
                            journey. Span categorization opens a larger vocabulary of overlapping
                            labels and roles for the analysis of literary texts.  </p>
                    <p>Additionally, recent work has demonstrated that the recognition of non-named
                        entities can be a powerful tool for decolonizing historical texts. Enslaved
                        people are often mentioned but not by name. There is key information in
                        historical records about these people and their history. Span categorization
                        provides the ability to find unnamed entities in a large corpus of texts. 
                        The LitBank dataset offers annotations from literary texts with annotations
                        for a wide range of people that are mentioned but whose proper name is not
                        given. </p>

                    <p>This workshop builds on an existing collaboration
                            between the Princeton Center for Digital Humanities and the developers
                            of the spaCy open-source NLP library. At DH2019, the organizers offered
                            a workshop on “Introduction to Natural Language Processing for DH
                            Research with SpaCy” (<ref target="https://medium.com/@ajanco_76905/digital-humanities-spacy-workshop-bd71d69a4641"> more </ref>). The session was well attended and featured a
                            valuable discussion between digital humanists and the spaCy developers.
                            Academic research brings new problems and use cases that can inform the
                            design of open-source tools. A tool that David Lassner created for the
                            session was later awarded the 2021 Rahtz Prize for TEI Ingenuity. The
                            organizers build on this experience for an NEH-funded Institute called
                            “New Languages for NLP: Building Linguistic Diversity in the Digital
                            Humanities.” The new languages project developed instructional materials
                            to train digital humanists how to annotate texts and train spaCy models
                            for the languages and domains of their research. Ines Montani, the
                            co-founder of Explosion and core developer of spaCy participated in the
                            workshop and gave a keynote lecture.  </p>

                    <p>We expect to have 20-30 participants for the workshop based on past
                        experience.</p>
                    <p>This is an intermediate-level workshop and participants should come with
                        basic knowledge of Python. Participants will need to bring a laptop or
                        tablet and keyboard with them to the session. A wifi connection is needed to
                        connect to the cloud notebooks.   </p>

                        access with a browser during the workshop using their laptops or tablets.
                        The only requirement will be an internet connected device. All materials
                        will be shared on GitHub for later reference.   </p>
