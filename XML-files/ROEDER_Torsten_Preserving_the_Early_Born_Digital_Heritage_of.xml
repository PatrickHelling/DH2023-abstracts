                <head>What are Disk Magazines?</head>
                <p>Disk magazines, also called 'diskmags', 'diskzines' or 'magazette' – were a
                    multimedia periodical for reading on personal computers, which were published on
                    digital media exclusively, such as data tapes, floppy disks or CD-ROMs. They
                    differ from so-called "covermounts" which were included in some print magazines,
                    because the main content of diskmags was on the disk and not in the printed
                    component.</p>
                <p>The historical peak of disk magazines can be dated roughly to the late 1980s and
                    early 1990s. They were primarily produced in the US, UK, West Germany, Italy,
                    Sweden, Finland and other countries. Wikipedia lists about 200 disk magazine
                    titles from that time, however the list is incomplete and not representative.
                    Most of the disk magazines were in English, but there were more relevant
                    language communities, e.g. in German, Spanish, Dutch, Russian, Polish and
                    Italian.</p>
                <p>Reading a disk magazine was only possible on the computer system it was designed
                    for. Many of them were sold in regular newspaper shops for a pocket money, with
                    a relevant secondary readership by trading and pirate copies, while others were
                    distributed only by copying. When the World Wide Web took over in the 1990s,
                    most disk magazines were discontinued or migrated to online platforms, sometimes
                    keeping ‘disk magazine’ in their title.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="div1">
                <head>State of Preservation</head>
                <p>Disk magazines were not yet collected or archived systematically by libraries or
                    archives like print magazines were. Further, there is no reliable or
                    comprehensive index that would offer a starting point for systematic research.
                    The situation is precarious. Floppy disks degrade over time and become
                    unreadable after 10‑30 years. Even if they are still readable, they require
                    suitable devices to be read. Hardware also deteriorates over time and needs to
                    be repaired, replaced or reconstructed. Access through the original hardware, so
                    it seems, is not a solution for frequent access.</p>
                <p>Emulation is a better scenario. It requires bitstream copies of the original
                    disks, and luckily, diskmags have an active fanbase which collects and provides
                    the required files. This is legally questionable due to copyright implications,
                    but if these legal issues can be resolved, these community-created collections
                    would be a good starting point to create a scientific collection.</p>
                <p>Another option is migration: extract the media from the disk magazines and
                    provide these in a new environment. This would also allow corpus-based research
                    and systematic search functions. Such "re-digitized" editions would ideally
                    consist of structured transcriptions of the originals, with inclusion of
                    multimedia elements and direct links to emulators, and integration into a linked
                    data network.</p>

                <head>One-Year Strategy</head>
                <p>A one-year project was recently funded by the consortium "Text+" of the German
                    research programme "National Research Data Infrastructure" (NFDI) to preserve
                    the digital heritage of Disk Magazines. The project will be hosted at the Center
                    of Philology and Digitality, a new department of the University in Würzburg
                    (Germany). The poster will present the design of the project and the planned
                    activities around it.</p>
                <p>One aim of this project is to develop and apply media extraction and
                    re-digitization methods for disk magazines. This creates a text resource of
                    particular value for cultural studies, linguistics and media studies. Second, it
                    provides a generalizable best practice for digital text reconstruction from
                    legacy file formats.</p>
                <p>The project is designed in multiple stages: (1) Create an international catalog
                    of disk magazines (titles), based on library standards and open for
                    contributions by other parties. Building up the catalog is intended to be an
                    incremental process that builds on combining existing collections, which are
                    usually focused on one system or one language region. OpenRefine ( <ref target="https://openrefine.org/">https://openrefine.org/</ref>) has proven so far to be very helpful in
                    this process. (2) Extend the catalog by indexing all available issues of
                    German-language disk magazines, including binary copies of the original files,
                    when available. The international catalog of titles and the sub-catalog of
                    German issues will be fed into German library catalogs through FactGrid ( <ref target="https://database.factgrid.de/">https://database.factgrid.de/</ref>). (3) The binaries are searched for
                    files containing (possibly compressed) text, then transformed from the
                    respective historical character set standard as closely as possible to UTF-8,
                    with a strict documentation of the character mapping. This stage is more
                    experimental and requires specific knowledge of the various systems. (4) From
                    this, flat hierarchical text files (TEI/XML) are generated and stored
                    sustainably according to FAIR principles by partners of the Text+ consortium. </p>
                <p>This project is a contribution to create awareness of early digital heritage for
                    the next generations. For example, providing the texts helps to preserve the
                    original language of content creators and communities. Additionally, the project
                    has a high potential to fill some white gaps in authority records by providing
                    data for the LOD network, which could become points of reference for studies in
                    the same field, e.g. game and software studies.</p>
                <p>Another grant application will be filed in 2023 for a project of longer duration.
                    This project will focus on NER and NEL and creating exemplary digital scholarly
                    editions as well.</p>
