            <p>The importance of project planning has increased
                    dramatically due to work shifting to hybrid or remote environments during the
                    coronavirus pandemic, and there is now an even greater need to communicate
                    across teams and between individuals. Centers for Digital Humanities and Digital
                    Scholarship Centers (CDH/DSC) now widely practice project management, and
                    project management skills specific to DH have been taught for over a decade in
                    courses (Bailar and Spiro) and workshops (Siemens 343). Yet, communication needs
                    themselves may shift in hybrid and remote contexts. For example, the Princeton
                    CDH (Center for Digital Humanities) recently changed their project charter in
                    response to how projects were working in practice. Two projects, including one
                    chartered fully remotely, were key in the center’s decision to make those
                    changes. Their work plan became “a more abstract roadmap that divides planned
                    work into stages” rather than a detailed plan because work changes as the
                    projects develop (Budak). In other words, the work plan acknowledged inevitable
                    uncertainties. While uncertainty has always been a reality in digital
                    scholarship work because the field changes rapidly, remote work has encouraged a
                    rethinking of how to plan for this uncertainty with more flexible models. In
                    addition, remote work has increased the need to intentionally build trust in
                    collaboration. Derek Thompson writes that “it’s hard to build true intimacy via
                    Zoom and chat. One of the most profound things that I’ve heard in my two years
                    reporting on remote work is the idea that digital communications can be a
                    minefield for trust” (“The Biggest Problem”). DSC/DHCs now often need to create
                    project planning documents that include uncertainty: this includes uncertainty
                    in how the field is developing, how staff will build new skills to meet the new
                    demands of the field, how external collaborators will respond to project plans
                    that have uncertainty built into them, and uncertainty in working in remote and
                    hybrid teams. While not all of these uncertainties are specific to digital
                    scholarship work, uncertainty is constant in the field. For DSC/DHC, a central
                    concern throughout project planning is the importance of balancing uncertainty
                    with the need to trust staff and build trust with external collaborators (e.g.,
                    faculty). With this in mind, this paper aggregates project planning literature
                    from the point of view of DSC/DHC management in order to analyze three questions
                    inherent to project planning that have not yet been brought together: First, how
                    can management determine the feasibility of taking on a project while also
                    transparently communicating professional development needs to external
                    collaborators? Second, how can management provide professional development
                    opportunities for the team to build skills while simultaneously putting those
                    skills into practice? Third, how can management invite faculty collaborators (or
                    external collaborators more generally) to join in project planning while still
                    ensuring that the project remains feasible in terms of the work the DSC/DHC is
                    performing?</p>
