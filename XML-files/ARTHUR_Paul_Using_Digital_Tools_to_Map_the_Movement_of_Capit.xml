            <p>This paper reports on an Australian Research Council-funded project, ‘Western
                Australian Legacies of British Slavery’, focusing on development of digital tools to
                map biographical narratives and data relating to the legacies of British slavery in
                Australia from the 1830s onward ( <ref target="https://australian-legacies-slavery.org/about">https://australian-legacies-slavery.org/about</ref>). This data-intensive
                project is tracing the movement of capital, people, and culture from slave-owning
                Britain to Western Australia, to produce new understandings of the continuing impact
                of slavery wealth in shaping colonial immigration, investment, and law. The project
                seeks to reveal how wealth from slavery led to the formation of Australian
                institutions, funded large land holdings, and helped form influential networks of
                association in the early colonial period that coincided with the abolition of
                slavery in Britain. It also investigates the experience of Aboriginal peoples in
                relation to the history of slavery. </p>
            <p>The research data being generated – looking at the movement of people, the
                distribution of networks, and land – lends itself to mapping and geo-spatial
                visualisation and analysis. To explore the lives and movements of individuals
                connected to slavery who migrated to Western Australia, the research team is
                utilising the Australian research infrastructure the ‘Time-Layered Cultural Map of
                Australia’ (TLCMap) ( <ref target="https://www.tlcmap.org/">https://www.tlcmap.org/</ref>). This resource has been developed to help
                researchers create digital maps from cultural, textual, and historical data, layered
                with datasets registered on the platform. TLCMap is a set of online tools that
                allows humanities researchers to compile humanities data using spatio-temporal
                coordinates – a ‘software ecosystem’ for researchers with minimal programming skills
                to upload, gather, analyse and visualise data. </p>
            <p>Our presentation gives a report on a series of biographical mapping and visualisation
                experiments using TLCMap to show movement and influence of slavery wealth using the
                Gazetteer of Historical Australian Places. The Gazetteer allows researchers to
                create layers on a 3D map which pinpoint locations with accompanying information,
                enabling us to plot out journeys of slavers and slave-trade beneficiaries as they
                moved across Britain, the Caribbean and to Western Australia. For our trial data we
                selected six individuals, choosing those with the most available data and digital
                assets, and who also offered a range in gender, geographical destinations and
                biographical events. For each individual we created a separate layer, uploaded as
                CSV files converted from Excel spreadsheets. Data on individuals included latitude
                and longitude for the geographical places they visited or lived in, place names,
                short biographical summary text, and links to data stored in other databases and
                archives. In the 3D map this translated to a staged journey for each individual,
                represented by a series of points on the map accompanied by brief narrative text
                regarding time spent at that location, links to images and further resources.</p>
            <p>TLCMap offered a number of advantages. The ability to embed links to records in other
                collections and databases allowed us to point to entries in the Legacies of British
                Slavery (LBS) database at University College London ( <ref target="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/">https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/</ref>), and the
                People Australia resource maintained by the National Centre of Biography at the
                Australian National University ( <ref target="https://peopleaustralia.anu.edu.au/">https://peopleaustralia.anu.edu.au/</ref>) – both project partners. While other
                databases and platforms enable network analysis to reveal family, business and
                various connections between individuals, TLCMap is the only purpose-designed,
                Australian-developed research tool for humanities and social science researchers to
                be able to visually represent these connections, allowing researchers to identify
                geographical clusters and parallel journeys by sight. </p>
            <p>There are many challenges and complexities in mapping a life. This begins with
                choices around what information is presented and what is left out. In selecting
                biographical data to map out the WALBS people of interest, we were guided in part by
                parameters regarding the functionality of the TLCMap platform. In particular, data
                was structured around geographical and temporal coordinates. Due to the research
                theme, another mandatory field of data was ‘links to slavery’, where brief narrative
                text outlined the particular family or business connections an individual held with
                the slave trade. However, as individuals and journeys dated back approximately 200
                years, ensuring their stories were rich with biographical data was not always
                possible. Often, records were limited and the issue of missing or ‘fuzzy’ data was a
                recurrent one. At times we could identify accurate spatial coordinates, for example
                by looking at ship records to locate particular ports of departures and arrivals, or
                identifying specific estates or plantations. Yet much of the time this information
                was less precise – for example an individual’s diary entry referring to a broad
                region, or a former place name that no longer exists. In these instances we made
                estimates, and included fields for notes – ‘Date notes’ and ‘Location notes’ – where
                we could explain the limitations of our data and our process for devising
                estimations. The presentation provides an overview of this project in development,
                covering these and other key aspects.</p>
