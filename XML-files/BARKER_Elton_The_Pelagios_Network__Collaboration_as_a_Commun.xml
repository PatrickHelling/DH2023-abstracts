            <p>In this panel we discuss the Pelagios Network
                    (https://pelagios.org/), a decade-long collaboration that has been developing
                    methods, tools and communities for linking Humanities resources online.</p>
            <p>From its establishment in 2011, Pelagios has used collaboration as
                    the means to transform the practice of Linked Open Data (LOD). In contrast to
                    other initiatives that have promoted complex, if robust, ontologies for
                    producing LOD, Pelagios phases 1-2 developed — in collaboration with popular
                    ancient Mediterranean data providers — a lightweight method of connecting
                    heterogeneous resources based on the semantic annotation of place references and
                    their alignment to gazetteer URIs (Vitale et al. 2021). To extend this method to
                    other disciplines lacking the maturity of such a specialist environment,
                    Pelagios 3-5 developed the annotation tool, Recogito
                    (https://recogito.pelagios.org/), which empowers the domain expert to
                    semantically annotate materials without need for technical know-how (Simon et
                    al. 2017). Finally, Pelagios 6-8 coordinated a "small grant" programme that
                    supported the conceptual articulation of Humanities LOD ("Working Groups") and
                    the development of common tools ("Resource Development Grants"), which succeeded
                    in extending the Pelagios method into knowledge domains from the global South
                    (Kahn et al. 2021). Ultimately, this growing and maturing community has been
                    realised in the foundation of a formal voluntary, and free, organisation: the
                    Pelagios Network Association.</p>
            <p>This panel is a demonstration of the decentralised collaborative
                    principle at the heart of Pelagios. The Pelagios Network is formed of equal and
                    interdependent Partners who, via a process of a formally-agreed plan, come
                    together on a regular bi-monthly basis to coordinate work according to
                    thematically-focused Activities — currently: annotation, gazetteers, registry,
                    and visualisation. The five panellists represent Partner projects or
                    institutions who have been contributing to this endeavour in various ways; the
                    opportunities afforded by Pelagios's collaborative framework that we showcase
                    here range from the low-hanging fruit of sharing knowledge to more complex
                    interactions through which Partners are continuing to develop tools and
                    infrastructure. Two speakers discuss the opportunity for collaborative
                    problem-solving (Chen) and the sharing of not only knowledge but also data, best
                    practice, and standards (Ghelfdof). Three speakers discuss the opportunity for
                    developing tools in the round (and thus avoid reinventing the wheel), whether in
                    the adaptation of a common toolset to different projects (Nury), the development
                    of machine-learning techniques to existing software (Vitale), or the application
                    of tools from one domain to another (Gordin). The final speaker (Middle)
                    reflects on the set of continuing challenges facing the widespread adoption of
                    LOD in the Humanities — namely, how rich, heterogeneous datasets, with huge
                    research potential, can be managed and published in a form that is flexible,
                    scalable, interoperable, and sustainable — and the opportunities afforded by
                    working collectively under the Pelagios umbrella.</p>
            <p>Together, we emphasise a ground-up,
                co-creation approach where collaboration is conceived as a community of practice.
                Critical in our discussion will be the identification and consideration of core
                issues, specifically the challenge of addressing and managing a series of tensions
                between decentralisation and coordination, development and sustainability, and
                individual needs versus community growth.</p>

                <p>This paper argues that foregrounding the “struggle” of interpretive decision-making in the lead-up to a target output (publication or otherwise) presents previously unanticipated collaborative opportunities with the potential to benefit future humanities research more broadly. Traditional humanities research has been a rather solitary pursuit: a single scholar collects thematically related content, reads past scholarship, makes editorial or interpretive decisions, and then (hopefully) synthesises the products for publication in an article or book. It is only in the rather mature stages of research — either in the context of a final publication, or else in a conference presentation (often in the lead-up to publication) — that there has traditionally been an opportunity for interfacing with a broader research community. How often have humanities scholars unnecessarily reinvented the wheel or else worked at cross-purposes thanks to this traditional research structure? </p>
                <p>With the introduction of digital methodologies into humanities
                        disciplines, one of the not-so-often reflected-upon benefits is the fact
                        that a sense of “strangeness” or destabilisation in the “how-to” of research
                        has necessitated repeated consultation with a broader community long before
                        project completion. The Pelagios Network, with its international membership
                        and online meeting structure, has created a thriving community of practice
                        for in-process collaborative problem-solving. As an illustrative case study,
                        this presentation draws on a collaborative endeavour — the formalisation and
                        unification of independent project efforts in Arabic vocabulary
                        disambiguation for cultural heritage descriptors — an effort conceived
                        thanks to regular network-partner reporting on work-in-progress via the
                        Pelagios Network’s linked-data Annotation activity.</p>

                <p>Trismegistos (TM,
                        https://www.trismegistos.org/) has a longstanding collaboration with
                        Pelagios that is exemplary for the importance of sharing data and knowledge
                        across partners, projects, and domains. To scale-up and improve the TM
                        Places gazetteer, we exchanged data with partners in the Pelagios Gazetteer Activity.<ref target="https://pelagios.org/activities/gazetteers/"> </ref>An initial helpful tool was Peripleo
                    (https://github.com/pelagios/peripleo),
                     a map interface that visualised connections between different projects based on their place references. Not only could users query this LOD graph; it also allowed researchers to easily view errors or disambiguate place names. This resulted in a further expansion of TM Places with links to other gazetteers, beyond our pre-existing collaborations with Pleiades
                    (https://pleiades.stoa.org/)
                     and EDH
                    (https://edh.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/). </p>
                <p>As a next step to share geographical data, we launched
                        the TM<ref target="https://www.trismegistos.org/dataservices/georelations/documentation/"> </ref>GeoRelations API (part of the TM Data Services,
                    https://www.trismegistos.org/dataservices/georelations/documentation/
                    ), enabling users to query multiple gazetteers. By including links to modern place names, TM Places can also be combined with other gazetteers to form a larger data set of historical place names (e.g., data sets collected in the Pelagios Registry Activity). To
                    further grow TM, the Pelagios Network, as well as the Linked Pasts ecosystem
                    that it has initiated, provides an optimum infrastructure, precisely because it
                    is based on the exchange and development of best practices, standards, and
                    expertise (see
                    https://medium.com/pelagios/from-linking-places-to-a-linked-pasts-network-ebc974f5b342).
                    Specifically, collaboration with Partners in the Registry Activity and further
                    development of PeripleoLite — an adaptable LOD visualisation tool
                    (https://github.com/britishlibrary/peripleo) — will help us continue to ensure
                    the usability and value of TM. </p>

                <p>To create a geographic data visualisation for the MARK16
                        project, the critical question facing us has been: what tool and data format
                        can we use that can be implemented within a short deadline and a limited
                        budget, while still being able to display complex research data? The
                        Pelagios Network is grounding MARK16 into the broader community of practices
                        around Humanities Linked Open Data and Historical GIS.</p>
                <p>MARK16 is focused on the last chapter of Mark’s Gospel, an
                        enigma in New Testament textual criticism (Clivaz 2019). The Virtual
                        Research Environment created for this five-year SNSF project includes four
                        parts, among which <hi rend="italic">Dataviz</hi> displays the manuscripts
                        and their repositories on a map. The main part is a <hi rend="italic">Manuscript</hi><hi rend="italic"> Room</hi> which currently holds 57
                        manuscripts with images and transcriptions ( <ref target="https://mr-mark16.sib.swiss">https://mr-mark16.sib.swiss</ref>).</p>
                <p>MARK16 Dataviz is using the new <hi rend="italic">PeripleoLite</hi> javascript viewer (Simon et al. 2016, 2022). Our
                        dataset of 36 places linked to 57 manuscripts necessitated adjustments to
                        the faceted search of <hi rend="italic">PeripleoLite</hi>
                        (https://dataviz-mark16.sib.swiss). To showcase the libraries who
                        participated in MARK16, while also being able to search the manuscripts, we
                        benefited from the help of its creator Rainer Simon. Preparing the
                        visualisation has raised interesting questions for us: what is the physical
                        anchor to the world of a library that exists purely in a digital format?
                        What happens when physical objects are shared in different places, as for
                        the Gothic manuscript Got 1? As we discuss our Dataviz with the Pelagios
                        Visualisation Activity, we are also contributing to the tool co-creation
                        process. </p>

                <p>Valeria Vitale [presenter] (University
                    of Sheffield), v.vitale@sheffield.ac.uk</p>

                    Institute), kmcdonough@turing.ac.uk</p>
                <p>Recogito and Peripleo, the online tools developed by
                        Pelagios, have proven highly popular in Humanities research and pedagogy
                        (Dunn and Vitale 2021). However, when core Pelagios funding ended in 2019,
                        the question of how to maintain these tools or develop others was critical
                        for the community that formed the Pelagios Network (Kahn et al. 2021). The
                        path to achieving long-term self-sustainability has been to encourage as
                        many open customisations as possible, specifically to:</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>generate a library of reusable “modules”;</item>
                    <item>foster a community of developers;</item>
                    <item>inspire researchers about the potential of Recogito
                            and Peripleo beyond their main versions.</item>
                </list>
                <p>As shown by projects like MARK16, this “diffused strategy” has generated a number of new applications sharing a common methodology. Here, we focus on the <hi rend="italic">Machines Reading Maps </hi>project (Chiang et al. 2021). MRM aims to apply machine
                        learning (ML) and semantic technologies to identify, gather, and make
                        available text on maps. Recogito was initially proposed as a means to create
                        gold-standard annotations to evaluate the ML algorithm, but we quickly
                        realised that the potential was much higher, and that Recogito could become
                        a powerful way to investigate maps from a semiotic perspective. The new
                        Recogito has been informed by MRM research questions, and has in turn shaped
                        the research. The MRM-specific version of Recogito has already been adopted
                        by other projects, both within and outside academia, where new applications
                        in community mapping are being explored, including volunteer transcription
                        of historical maps in collaboration with the National Library of Scotland.

                <p>One of the central characteristics of Digital Humanities
                        is the multitude of projects that involve intense collaboration across
                        disciplines. It is much less common to find collaborative research networks
                        like Pelagios. In this talk we consider how Pelagios's collaborative model
                        has the potential to revolutionise the way in which we computationally study
                        ancient languages.</p>
                <p>Originally established to bring together scholars around
                        the common theme of historical places and spaces, Pelagios has evolved into
                        an interdisciplinary virtual space for those who study the ancient and
                        pre-modern world from a multitude of computational perspectives. One of its
                        main tools, Recogito, has shown great promise in the collaborative labelling
                        of data for machine learning purposes, such as in the Machines Reading Maps
                        project. From the Near East to the Mediterranean, texts and inscriptions in
                        cuneiform and ancient alphabets share similar challenges not only in their
                        digitization — which requires specialised optical character recognition
                        models — but also in the philological nature of their study. Among the
                        largest corpora, those of Greek and Akkadian share similar types of genres
                        and reconstruction methods. But how available are these sources for advanced
                        methods like machine learning models? Can we use knowledge from one language
                        to improve these models for better results in the other, also called
                        transfer learning? Can we handle the bias in models trained on limited or
                        fragmentary corpora? These are just some of the challenges going forward
                        that we will be addressing through shared annotation and corpus building
                        under the umbrella of the Pelagios network.</p>

                <p>It is likely that the application of LOD approaches to
                        the Humanities will result in large, rich, heterogeneous datasets with huge
                        research potential, but in turn raise a considerable challenge: how can
                        these datasets be managed and published in forms that are flexible,
                        scalable, interoperable and, critically, usable and sustainable? Several
                        infrastructures exist that aim to address this issue, but each come with
                        challenges of their own, including the balance between the need for
                        off-the-shelf front-end solutions and for APIs that can support custom user
                        interfaces, including explorable data visualisations.</p>
                <p>Having faced these challenges in our use of Arches
                    (https://www.archesproject.org/)
                     for the Tools of Knowledge
                    (https://toolsofknowledge.org/) project database, we
                        sought to harness the knowledge and experience of the Pelagios and Linked
                        Pasts communities to establish requirements for an optimum system. As a
                        foundation for this research, we are organising an activity at the annual
                        Linked Pasts symposium (https://www.seadda.eu/?p=180, December 2022) to
                        generate discussion around the topic, which will take place both
                        asynchronously and in person. Our results will form the basis of a white
                        paper, to be shared with the Pelagios community for further input and
                        refinement.</p>
                <p>Our contribution to this panel will take a speculative
                        design approach to our findings, envisaging a potential future system for
                        managing and publishing large, heterogeneous Linked Humanities Data, which
                        meets this community's needs. In addition, we propose to reflect upon our
                        experiences of engaging in community-led, collaborative research, as well as
                        the learning opportunities provided by knowledge sharing among the Pelagios
                        Network.</p>
