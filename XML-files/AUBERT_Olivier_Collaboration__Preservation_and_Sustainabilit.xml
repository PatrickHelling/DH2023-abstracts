            <p>This paper discusses interdisciplinary collaborative
                    practices based on the AdA project (meaning “Affektrhetoriken des
                    Audiovisuellen” <ref target="https://projectada.github.io/">https://projectada.github.io/</ref>) in which institutionally situated research groups from
                    computational sciences and film studies developed approaches for the analysis of
                    the temporal dynamics of audiovisual expressivity by bringing together a
                    theoretically informed methodology of film analysis and computational video
                    analysis and semantic video annotation. A corpus analysis of audiovisual
                    rhetorics on the financial crisis (2007–) required the groundwork for a
                    collaborative annotation process and resulted in the structured vocabulary of
                    the AdA Ontology (Bakels et al. 2020). The annotation process was carried out
                    with the open-source-software Advene (Aubert et al. 2005, <ref target="https://www.advene.org/">https://www.advene.org/</ref>). In an earlier publication (Aubert et al. 2021), we
                    already presented how co-building a Digital Humanities tool could be seen as
                    instrumental genesis. In it we concentrated on the iterative development of a
                    visualisation framework (see figure 1) to highlight the need for a common
                    language and for the consideration of time needed for collaboration.</p>
            <p><figure>
                    <graphic url="Pictures/aafa5156bf52dd48799a38a32d81971c.png"/>
                    <head>Figure 1: Advene is used as a generic tool to manipulate data. Based on
                        the experience, a dedicated web-based visualisation is designed and
                        implemented.</head>
                </figure></p>
            <p>We would like to pursue the reflection on the instrumental
                    genesis (Rabardel, 1995) of collaboration tools along the time dimension. We saw
                    that every step of tool development for such qualitative and exploratory
                    research requires time: may it be for tool sketching, development, testing, or
                    documenting its usage for manual annotation. </p>
            <p><figure>
                    <graphic url="Pictures/7fd1dfb40a67b55d463c11e571133be1.png"/>
                    <head>Figure 2: The Advene "data checker" component has been developed to
                        constantly highlight data quality issues.</head>
                </figure></p>
            <p>The instrumental genesis for Advene encompassed the development and integration of
                new feature extraction plugins as well as the extension of its UI for collaborative
                and time-efficient semantic annotation (see figure 2), which not only aimed a
                reducing labor time, but in turn helped the research practices (that can be seen as
                usage schemes) and related expectations to evolve. These practices and the tool
                development itself brought a need for different collaboration tooling which, as part
                of the distributed labor, required an acculturation to technical workflows.
                Especially in interdisciplinary projects, familiarity with different tools,
                environments and platforms such as GitHub can differ a lot and require adaptation
                efforts. For instance, we used GitHub as a way to collaborate as well to publish the
                open-source annotation data and its ontology (see figure 3).</p>
            <p><figure>
                    <graphic url="Pictures/7c0e4be87558200887be9360e97a13c9.png"/>
                    <head>Figure 3: The AdA project data files and websites are available on the
                        github platform.</head>
                </figure></p>
            <p>A key point to consider during projects is that the time
                    of a research project does not only cover the funded period. Community building
                    around research methods and practices mobilising specific data and tools, that
                    are in constant need for maintenance and evolution, requires more time. Long
                    term preservation of valuable (annotation) data as well as the sustainable
                    access to the tools that mediate them also needs to be considered. Compared to
                    historical archives such as books that are essentially stable and continuously
                    accessible, digital data access is not guaranteed if tools required to consult
                    it are not accessible and in a working state. Even if FAIR principles, such as
                    using open formats and stable identifiers, are used, dedicated tools are still
                    required to allow to consult the data in the most appropriate form, which
                    evolved along the research practices. Using open-source tools, like Advene in
                    our case, is a first step into digital preservation. But open-source software
                    must be maintained and adapted to changing digital environments. The AdA project
                    was, in a collectively profitable way, an opportunity to update the Advene
                    software to new environments. Both data and tools can be considered as Digital
                    Commons (Dulong de Rosnay et al, 2020), available openly to the community. As
                    such, their preservation and sustainability relies upon a shared concern and
                    involvement from the community at large or specific communities of practice. One
                    of the ways to participate in the maintenance and evolution of digital artefacts
                    is to pursue their exploitation and development in new projects as well as their
                    usage in scientific communication or teaching. These issues can be addressed
                    through documentation of the methodical usage of the annotation software for a
                    multi-annotator project-based film analysis that was produced as the AdA
                    Toolkit. In the usage of a software such as Advene that allows for
                    multiple-usage-scenarios the question of documentation points to a fundamental
                    arbitration between generalityand specificity, an arbitration that can be described as a
                    catalyst for processes of instrumental genesis. In this regard, a viable criticism of audiovisual rhetorics via
                    digital tools requires ongoing practices of collaboration.</p>
