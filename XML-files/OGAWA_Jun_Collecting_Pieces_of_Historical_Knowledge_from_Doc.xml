            <p><hi rend="bold">Historical knowledge representation and HIMOKO</hi></p>
            <p>Historical knowledge is made from various information extracted from various sources.
                This fact makes it difficult to develop a versatile data model for historical
                knowledge representation and must be the reason why models proposed in the field of
                digital history tend to be limited to specific areas, such as Factoid for
                prosopography [1], Knowledge Claims for Chinese literature [2], DEPCHA for
                accounting [3], etc. In this context, we propose HIMIKO ( <hi rend="bold">Hi</hi>storical <hi rend="bold">Mi</hi>cro <hi rend="bold">K</hi>nowledge and <hi rend="bold">O</hi>ntology) as a potential
                versatile model for Historical Linked Data. The ‘micro-knowledge’ is a basic data
                unit representing a specific statement in a document mentioning historical
                situations, actions, or states of affairs. </p>
            <p><hi rend="bold">HIMIKO Model</hi></p>
            <p>HIMIKO should effectively collect pieces of knowledge represented in various
                documents, semantically organize, and link them to universal and unique entities
                existing outside of the documents. The last part of the process, which is the
                linking between the inside and outside of the documents, has been already realized
                by many studies. They annotate entities in documents and link them to external
                counterparts by using semantic web technologies [4]. On the other hand, they have
                hardly organized internal semantic relations within a document, which we call
                ‘intra-knowledge’. It is this problem that HIMIKO works through: how specific
                historical phenomena were represented in a particular document, who or what is
                mentioned, which word or image is used to represent certain objects or concepts, or
                with what kind of causal or temporal relations statements are connected? Fig. 1 is
                the data created with HIMIKO. </p>
            <figure>
                <graphic n="1001" width="14.032388888888889cm" height="6.928733333333334cm" url="Pictures/01d724f940a3565b324eb603488dfe79.jpeg" rend="inline"/>
                <head>Fig. 1: Data constructed with HIMIKO model (Image of the manuscript is taken
                    from British Library MS Viewer: <ref target="http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=add_ms_10084_f011r">http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=add_ms_10084_f011r</ref></head>
            </figure>
            <p>The basic structure resembles Factoid, which structures the biographical data based
                on primary sources. While referring to it, HIMIKO achieves a more elaborate
                description of intra-knowledge in two points: firstly, word and character level
                structuring guarantees high referentiality to the primary source descriptions, and
                secondly, as we semantically connect and nest micro-knowledge resources, the whole
                semantic structure of the document can be preserved as data. </p>
            <p>Such a document-based model enables us to deal with, not only the biographical data
                concerning mainly persons and places, but also any pieces of information written in
                sources, such as a mention of small objects or concepts, descriptions about the
                natural condition or spatial arrangement, or verbs used to represent historical
                events, and their semantic relationships. One example demonstrating the advantage of
                this model is the visualization in Fig. 2. </p>

                <head>Fig. 2: Visualization of text and network based on HIMIKO data</head>
            </figure>
            <p>The network contains various entities mentioned in the document, such as statements,
                persons, organizations, places, concepts, and objects. These elements are
                semantically connected, and the network as a whole shows the outline of the semantic
                structure of the document. Since each node on the network is linked to a specific
                word or sentence in the text, it is possible to search the text from the network and
                vice versa. Obviously, it is possible to explore the data quite in detail with
                SPARQL queries, for example, “What is the verb frequently used in the statements
                mentioning any specific person?”, or “Which concept or object is mentioned together
                with some specific place in same statements?” Being able to ask these questions by
                using linked data technologies must bring new possibilities for digital historical
                analysis. </p>
            <p><hi rend="bold">Data construction workflow of HIMIKO</hi></p>
            <p>To effectively construct a large amount of data, we are now developing HIMIKO Editor
                and setting a workflow (Fig. 3) for the entire process. HIMIKO Editor consists of
                two separate sub-editors: Entity　Editor is for annotating entities and accordingly
                editing the XML text file, while Micro Knowledge Editor is used to describe
                intra-knowledge in the form of RDF, linking it to external knowledge [5]. </p>
            <figure>
                <graphic n="1003" width="15.000111111111112cm" height="9.31686111111111cm" url="Pictures/a5c50d7785f8ea7042636d1f106aaffc.jpeg" rend="inline"/>
                <head>Fig. 3: Image of HIMIKO data construction workflow</head>
            </figure>
            <p>We have put two sets of documents to the editor and tried
                to construct micro-knowledge data. One is Caesar's <hi rend="italic">De Bello
                    Gallico</hi>, and the other is the diary documents provided by the Shibusawa
                Eiichi Diary website [6]. As a result, even though these two documents greatly
                differ in terms of their language, genre, and style of writing, we found that the
                model and the editor could be equally applied to both. This proves that HIMIKO has
                the potential to be a versatile data model for collecting pieces of historical
                knowledge from various documents and connecting them to broader knowledge both
                within and without the documents. Furthermore, as HIMIKO provides a package
                containing both the model and the editing system to make the data construction
                process much closer to normal reading activities, it would help historians without
                digital skills to produce highly sophisticated, structured data without much
                difficulty and encourage them to participate in the research of digital history.
