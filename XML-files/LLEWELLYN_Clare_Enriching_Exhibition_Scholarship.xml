        <body>
            <p>The co-exhibition of artworks has been part of cultural context for more than 250
                years. Exhibitions, physical and digital, make art relevant and accessible to
                artists, scholars and the general public in a managed and directed environment. This
                engagement influences emerging trends in style and the art market, but information
                on objects that were exhibited together, nor their reception from the audience, have
                been made available for art historical or digital humanities research.</p>
            <p>The Linked Art collaboration (Page et al. 2020) has developed a modern Linked Open
                Usable Data (Sanderson 2019) set of specifications to describe and publish
                art-related knowledge, including which objects were shown during which exhibitions.
                For this data to be truly connected, enabling scholars to seamlessly traverse
                institutional silos, descriptions of exhibition events and art objects must be
                "reconciled": the descriptions of the same object should be connected together by
                matching identifiers in different systems at different institutions.</p>
            <p>The Enriching Exhibition Scholarship project is developing methodology to align
                socially-based textual and structured data, such as exhibition catalogues,
                newspapers and social media, making reconciliation easier and more effective.
                Aligning and enhancing records requires art history domain expertise, specific
                cultural heritage metadata knowledge, and advanced computational research in text
                analytics, machine learning, and information retrieval. This methodology includes a
                pipeline consisting of pre-processing, named entity recognition, and retrieval.
                Queries, generated by isolating and combining data are used to search extracted
                texts. Fuzzy matching scores for pairs of queries and texts are computed, those that
                meet retrieval and fuzzy matching score thresholds are considered matches. Such
                techniques help the pipeline address retrieval problems caused by variations in
                object and artist names.</p>

                <head>Figure 1. The production, acquisition and exhibitions of British
                    Gentlemen in Rome, by K. Read</head>
            </figure>
            <p>As an illustrative example, the Yale Center for British Art lent the Ashmolean Museum
                at Oxford 19 artworks for the exhibition The English Prize: The Capture of the
                Westmorland in 2012, including the painting British Gentlemen in Rome, by Katharine
                Read from circa 1750. That object was also lent to the Yale University Art Gallery
                for an exhibition in 1965 and most recently to the University of Arizona Museum of
                Art for their 2015 exhibition Rome: The Legacy of an Eternal City. Newspaper
                articles, such as in The Evening Standard and The Oxford Mail describe the
                exhibition and reference other works that were present, including Batoni Pompeo’s
                painting of Francis Basset, in the Museo del Prado. The exhibition catalogue is
                available from Yale University Press (ISBN 9780300176056), containing content and
                references.</p>
            <p>By mining social texts (in yellow, figure 1), and connecting with the Linked Art
                structured data from across institutions, we bring together both quantitative and
                qualitative information about objects presented and responses to them. This assists
                with provenance research, style transmission, patterns of lending, interactions
                between museums via network analysis, and trends in exhibition themes over time and
                venue.</p>
            <p>Exhibitions discussed in contemporary social texts provide the context of these
                exhibitions and their works as described at the time they were held, which is not
                otherwise easily available to researchers. Continuing the example, the Oxford Mail
                described the Grand Tour Exhibition held at the Ashmolean as a “a multi-layered
                show” and “a unique snapshot of the Grand Tour: what these British tourists aspired
                to, shopped for, in order to show off their good taste and erudition once home; what
                sights affected them”.</p>
            <p>These procedures are being conducted in an open and documented manner, and the
                alignment of objects from the lenders' catalogues with the borrowers' exhibition
                descriptions will allow enrichment of existing structured data. This project will
                publish the enhanced and transformed data as openly as possible, allowing additional
                research using the aggregated collection data. We hope that the results will
                incentivize museums to publish their data more openly, allowing exhibition
                descriptions to link across institutions.</p>
            <p>In September 2022 we held a workshop to establish useful sources of exhibition
                information and define possible research questions. This consultation highlighted
                the importance of determining the context and contents of an exhibition to analyse
                the movement of objects within and across institutions, the differences between
                physical and digital exhibitions and their catalogues and promotional material, and
                whether exhibitions are more inclusive than permanent displays. We will have future
                workshops to demonstrate project findings and generate further engagement across
                communities.</p>
            <p>This combination of theory, practice and digital tools allows us to rethink ways of
                working together and illustrates new opportunities enabled through that
                collaboration, including potential avenues for research and scholarship as well as
                developing museum practice.</p>
